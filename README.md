This project is an autonomous AI platform that takes raw CSV data and automatically converts it into meaningful business insights without manual intervention. The entire system is built using Python as the core programming language, with Pandas and NumPy handling data loading, profiling, and cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, filling missing values, and detecting outliers.
Once the data is cleaned, the platform performs feature engineering using Pandas and Scikit Learn. It creates useful columns such as revenue and time based features, encodes categorical values, and scales numerical data to prepare it for machine learning. The processed data is then used to train multiple models including Linear Regression and Random Forest from Scikit Learn. These models are evaluated using standard metrics, and the best performing model is automatically selected and saved using Joblib.
After training, the system monitors data distribution and model performance using NumPy and Pandas to detect drift and accuracy loss. If performance drops, the pipeline can trigger automatic retraining to maintain reliability. At the same time, analytical reports generated by the system are analyzed by a large language model using the Groq API with Llama models, which produces easy to understand business insights, recommendations, and risk analysis.
